</p>


This is a fork of the rrweb library, which is a web recording and replaying library. This fork is specifically tailored for use with Supademo. Most of the code is the same as the original rrweb library, but there are some differences in the way the library is taking and bulking the snapshots in [rrweb-snapshot](./packages/rrweb-snapshot)
